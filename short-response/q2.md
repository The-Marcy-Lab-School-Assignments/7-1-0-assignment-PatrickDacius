# Question

What are the steps to incorporating context into your application?

# Answer
The steps to incorporating context into your application starts by:

1. first creating the context object 
Wrap our app's component providing all descendants with access to the contextValues that we choose.
implement the useContext hook to get access to the contextValues within a descendent component.

2. rendering the context object/ provider

Getting values from a Context - useContext(Context)
